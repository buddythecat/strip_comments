	State machine to remove C style comments from line input.
	Parses a line of input and outputs the line.  If the machine 
	encounters /* it starts to ignore the input until it reaches */.
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	Written in C, compiled with gcc.
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	- Two plain-text files are included with in the /bin/ folder, 
	input.txt and output.txt.  These are before and after
	examples of what the parser does.  The input is a copy
	of the strip_comments.c source (as it's an excellent demo
	of how well it can strip comments).
	- All source files are contained in the src directory.
=================================================================
	- The success of the program was testing using meld, a 
	differential program for GNOME.
